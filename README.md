A virtual art museum designed to simulate the experience of browsing galleries.
-      Used Image Mapper in React to create dynamic gallery navigation and to simulate the act of walking 
       through, curating, and commenting upon oneâ€™s own gallery.
-      Displayed organized artworks and descriptions through the Harvard Art Museum API.
-      Tailored API results to allow dynamic searching and to plot the mapping structure.
